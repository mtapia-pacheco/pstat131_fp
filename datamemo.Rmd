### Data Set Overview 

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a competitive, tactical first-person shooter 
in which two teams play against each other in objective-based game modes. Each 
team consists of 5 players who choose operators with unique abilities and both 
teams take turns defending and attacking an objective.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/mario/Desktop/r6_logo.jpeg")
```

The data set I will be using contains an observation for every player in every 
round played in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege over the course of 3 months. 
I found the data set on Kaggle. The data were originally shared by Ubisoft in 2020, 
the game's publisher, but were removed from the website because it is quite 
outdated. The link to the Kaggle data set is provided here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxcobra/rainbow-six-siege-s5-ranked-dataset.
  
The data set contains roughly 88 million observations and is split into 22 csv 
files. However, I will be reducing the number to 5,000 observations in order to save 
memory. There are 31 variables in total and only one of them is not categorical. 
Some are numeric indicators, but most are qualitative. Luckily, there are no 
missing data so I won't have to use any methods to deal with missing data.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}  
library(naniar)
data <- read.csv('/Users/mario/Desktop/HW/Y4/F23/PSTAT 131/datamemo/rainbow_data1.csv')
vis_miss(data)
```
  
### Research Question Overview

Using the data gathered, I want to predict whether a player will be on the 
winning team or the losing team given some of the variables in the data set.
More specifically, I'm interested in predicting the "haswon" variable that 
takes on the values 0 or 1 to note whether a player's team has won or 
lost. This question will best be answered using a classification model since 
our response variable can only take 2 categorical values. Rainbow Six Siege has 
a lot of factors that can change the outcome of a round, and I think the "gamemode", "objectivelocation", "clearancelevel", "isdead", "mapname", "role", "operator", 
and "nbkills" variables will be especially useful for my model. I think in a game 
like this, a player's skill, the operator they play, and the map and specific objective 
location they're playing on will have the biggest influence on the outcome of a 
round. The goal of my model is predictive since I'm using the collected data to predict a player's outcome in a round.

### Proposed Project Timeline

I plan to have my data set loaded and ready for EDA by the end of this weekend 
(Week 2). Then begin exploratory data analysis shortly after (Week 3) and work 
on implementing models throughout the quarter as we learn more models. I hope 
to be done with all the modeling around Week 8/9 where I'll start the final 
project write-up and fix any issues I might have with my project. I hope to have 
the project done around the end of Week 9 so that I can have time to change 
anything if needed before the deadline.

### My Questions/Concerns

The only concern I have is that almost all of my variables are categorical and 
that might cause some issues down the road. I don't have any questions at the 
moment, but I will definitely go to office hours if anything comes up.
