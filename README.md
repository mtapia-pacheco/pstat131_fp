# Rainbow Six Siege Predictive Modeling

This project is currently in progress and is anticipated to be completed very soon (1-2 weeks). I hope to build a classification model that will predict whether or not a player will win a round of the first-person shooter Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege given some information.
